SD5X-Electric-Drum-Light-Show
=============================

Arduino code that drives electroluminescent lights in sync with midi notes from a Simmons SD5X electric drum kit.

You can see a video of the kit with the lights here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_wOILqH7EU

This sketch requires the Arduino Midi Library and a custom El Escudo Extended library that I created.  I've included the Midi library in this repository.  You can find the El Escudo Extended library here: https://github.com/pkrakow/El-Escudo-Extended
